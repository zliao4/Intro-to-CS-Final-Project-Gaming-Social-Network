Intro-to-CS-Final-Project-Gaming-Social-Network

Background 
========== 
You and your friend have decided to start a company that hosts a gaming social network site. Your friend will handle the website creation (they know what they are doing, having taken our web development class). However, it is up to you to create a data structure that manages the game-network information and to define several procedures that operate on the network.  

In a website, the data is stored in a database. In our case, however, all the information comes in a big string of text. Each pair of sentences in the text is formatted as follows:  

<user> is connected to <user1>, ..., <userM>.<user> likes to play <game1>, ..., <gameN>. 
 
For example: 
  
John is connected to Bryant, Debra, Walter.John likes to play The Movie: The Game, The Legend of Corgi, Dinosaur Diner.

Note that each sentence will be separated from the next by only a period. There will not be whitespace or new lines between sentences. 

Your friend records the information in that string based on user activity on the website and gives it to you to manage. You can think of every pair of sentences as defining a user's profile. 

Consider the data structures that we have used in class - lists, dictionaries, and combinations of the two (e.g. lists of dictionaries). Pick one that will allow you to manage the data above and implement the procedures below.  
 
You may assume that <user> is a unique identifier for a user. For example, there can be at most one 'John' in the network. Furthermore, connections are not symmetric - if 'Bob' is connected to 'Alice', it does not mean that 'Alice' is connected to 'Bob'. 
 
Project Description 
==================== 
Your task is to complete the procedures according to the specifications below as well as to implement a Make-Your-Own procedure (MYOP). You are encouraged to define any additional helper procedures that can assist you in accomplishing a task.
